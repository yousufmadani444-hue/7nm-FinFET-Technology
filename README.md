## 🧩 Introduction
As semiconductor devices continued to scale beyond the limits of planar CMOS technology, maintaining performance and controlling leakage became increasingly difficult. FinFETs emerged as a **3D transistor design** that enabled further scaling into the **7 nm and beyond** technology nodes.

## ⚡ Why Did We Start Using FinFETs?

### Problems with Planar MOSFETs
- **Leakage Current:** At smaller channel lengths, current leaked even when the transistor was OFF.  
- **Poor Gate Control:** The gate couldn’t control the entire channel — leading to short-channel effects.  
- **High Power Dissipation:** Increased leakage meant more static power usage.  
- **Scaling Limitations:** Beyond ~30 nm, planar MOSFETs couldn’t scale efficiently.

### How FinFET Solved These Problems
- **3D Fin Structure:** The channel is formed as a thin fin of silicon.  
- **Multi-Gate Control:** The gate wraps around the fin on three sides → better electrostatic control.  
- **Reduced Leakage:** Improved control reduces off-state leakage.  
- **Better Performance:** Higher current drive and lower voltage operation.  

| Problem (Planar MOSFET) | Solution (FinFET) |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Leakage current | Multi-gate control |
| Poor electrostatic control | 3D channel design |
| Scaling limit | Works effectively at sub-20nm |
| High power | Lower operating voltage |

## 🧱 Structure of FinFET
- The **fin** is the channel region that protrudes vertically from the substrate.  
- The **gate** wraps around three sides of the fin.  
- The **source** and **drain** are formed at the ends of the fin.  

📘 This 3D structure allows for better control of the current flow between the source and drain.

## ⚙️ Challenges in 7nm Node
- **Process complexity:** Multi-patterning and EUV lithography needed.  
- **Increased variability:** Smaller fins increase manufacturing variation.  
- **Cost:** Equipment and mask costs rise steeply at 7nm.
