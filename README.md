## Introduction
As semiconductor devices continued to scale beyond the limits of planar CMOS technology, maintaining performance and controlling leakage became increasingly difficult. FinFETs emerged as a **3D transistor design** that enabled further scaling into the **7 nm and beyond** technology nodes.

## Why Did We Start Using FinFETs?
This becomes even more important — why did FinFET come into existence, and what were the challenges in planar MOSFETs?
So now, let us look at the challenges of planar MOSFETs:

In a normal planar MOSFET:

The source has electrons (in an nMOS).

The drain is at a higher voltage.

The gate controls whether electrons can flow from source → drain by forming or removing a conductive channel in the silicon under the gate.
